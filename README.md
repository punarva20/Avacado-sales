Due to the rise of vegetarianism,if the price of the avocado, depending on the varieties increased over time and if it has an impact on the total volume sold as well as the volume sold for three different PLU codes: 
### PLU4046: Hass small
### PLU4225: Hass large
### PLU4770: Hass extra large
I first imported, renamed some columns, inferred the schema and checked it out
Questions to answer
Does the price have an influence on the volume? 
Which areas consumed avocados the most from 2015 to 2021?
The PLU4770 being the biggest Hass variety, is it also the one consumed the most?

Hypothesis
Yes the price has an influence on the volume and vice versa. 
Mostly the highly developed areas because of the vegetarian trend
The consumer always going for the biggest, the cleanest, the most beautiful, is more likely to choose the biggest avocado variety
